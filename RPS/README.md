This is a simple rock-paper-scissor game with basic Java DialogueBox GUI that allows the user to play vs the AI for 3 rounds. 
Once 3 rounds have ended, the game will announce the winner and loop back to the beginning.

The RPS AI is a rudimentary randomized algorithm.

The source code can be viewed inside the src folder-->rps.java
